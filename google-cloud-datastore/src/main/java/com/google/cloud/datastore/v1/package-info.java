/**
 * A client to Cloud Datastore API
 *
 * <p>The interfaces provided are listed below, along with usage samples.
 *
 * <p>======================= DatastoreClient =======================
 *
 * <p>Service Description: Each RPC normalizes the partition IDs of the keys in its input entities,
 * and always returns entities with keys with normalized partition IDs. This applies to all keys and
 * entities, including those in values, except keys with both an empty path and an empty or unset
 * partition ID. Normalization of input keys sets the project ID (if not already set) to the project
 * ID from the request.
 *
 * <p>Sample for DatastoreClient:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code template only.
 * // It will require modifications to work:
 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * try (DatastoreClient datastoreClient = DatastoreClient.create()) {
 *   String projectId = "projectId-894832108";
 *   ReadOptions readOptions = ReadOptions.newBuilder().build();
 *   List<Key> keys = new ArrayList<>();
 *   LookupResponse response = datastoreClient.lookup(projectId, readOptions, keys);
 * }
 * }</pre>
